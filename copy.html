  Sunrise is building an army of young people to make climate change an urgent
  priority across America, end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel
  executives on our politics, and elect leaders who stand up for the health and
  wellbeing of all people. We are ordinary young people who are scared about
  what the climate crisis means for the people and places we love. Public
  opinion is already with us - if we unite by the millions we can turn this into
  political power and reclaim our democracy.
